        <h1><b style="margin: 55px; color: skyblue;">What is program</b></h1>
        <p>
        <pre>
            Program is a common computer term that can be used as both a noun and a verb. A program (noun) is executable
            software that runs on a computer. It is similar to a script, but is often much larger in size and does not
            require a scripting engine to run. Instead, a program consists of compiled code that can run directly from
            the computer's operating system.

            Examples of programs include Web browsers, word processors, e-mail clients, video games, and system
            utilities. These programs are often called applications, which can be used synonymously with "software
            programs." On Windows, programs typically have an .EXE file extension, while Macintosh programs have an .APP
            extension.

            When "program" is used as verb, it means to create a software program. For example, programmers create
            programs by writing code that instructs the computer what to do. The functions and commands written by the
            programmer are collectively referred to as source code. When the code is finished, the source code file or
            files are compiled into an executable program.</pre>

        <h1><b style="margin: 55px; color: rgb(85, 185, 224);">Types of program</b></h1>
        <p style="margin: 55px;">There are many different types of computer programs, most of which are mentioned in
            Wiki in various places
            (but nowhere are they listed in one place). By "type of computer program", we refer to a subset of
            programming which requires differing skills, methodologies, and tools than other types. A programmer can be
            familiar with one, several, or all of these types.

            <br>
            The taxonomy presented may be a bit arbitrary, and certainly could use some fine tuning. The categories are
            not intended to be mutually exclusive -- a program can fall into more than one type. There are probably also
            some useful programs out there which don't fit into any of the types listed below.

            <br>
            <b>Business Programming.</b> Also known as "business logic", "enterprise applications", and by a host of
            other
            names. This type consists mostly of custom software which is used to support an organization's management
            information system. This software is typically written in-house (or by contractors hired for the purpose),
            is usually not distributed outside the organization that it was written for, and is often highly integrated
            with the IT infrastructure and business processes of the organization.
